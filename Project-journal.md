- We read through the Projekt so we know what we need to do.
- After we figured out that it needs to be an IQ test we counted together what would be important for an IQ test.
- We also thought about what is important for an accurate IQ test.
- We planned what we need to do at which day

So basically we planned the project from the Ground.
